The web is the most powerful, dynamic, and open platform ever created. We use it to catch up on news, follow live sports, shop online, stay in touch with friends, and much more.

To build high-quality web applications, it's important to understand the core foundations of how the web operates. This guide explores key concepts such as **servers and clients**, **HTTP communication**, **DNS resolution**, **web technologies**, and **content delivery networks (CDNs).**

## Servers and Clients

Every interaction on the web involves **two key players**: the client and the server.

- The **client** is typically your web browser (like Chrome or Safari), running on your computer or phone. It sends requests whenever you visit a website.
- The **server** is a remote computer managed by a hosting provider, cloud platform, or self-hosted infrastructure. It listens for incoming requests and responds with the requested data or files.

When you visit a website, your **browser (client)** sends a request to a **server** asking for the page content. The server processes the request and returns the necessary files that make up the webpage.

## How the Web Communicates

Whenever you type a website address into your browser, your browser and a _server_ communicate using **HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)**.

Think of it like sending letters back and forth:

1. Your browser (the _client_) sends an **HTTP request** asking for something specific, like a webpage or an image.
2. The server processes the request and sends an **HTTP response**, which includes the requested content (or an error if something went wrong).

### How Do We Handle This Securely?

To protect sensitive data, websites use **HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure)**. HTTPS encrypts the communication between the client and server, preventing attackers from intercepting data like passwords and credit card information.

## How Domain Names Work

Instead of remembering complex numerical **IP addresses**, users enter **domain names** (e.g. example.com). This is where **DNS (Domain Name System)** comes in.

DNS works like an internet phonebook:

1. When you type a domain name into your browser, your computer sends a request to a **DNS server**.
2. The DNS server looks up the domain and finds the corresponding **IP address**.
3. Your browser then uses that IP address to request the website from the correct server.

This system makes the web far more user-friendly by allowing users to navigate using human-readable names instead of numeric IP addresses.

## What Makes Up a Web Application?

When you visit a site, your browser retrieves multiple files from the server. These files typically include:

### **1. HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)**

- HTML provides the **structure** of the webpage.
- Defines elements like headings, paragraphs, images, and buttons.
- Determines _what_ appears on the page but not _how_ it looks.

### **2. CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)**

- CSS controls the **styling and layout** of the webpage.
- Specifies colors, fonts, spacing, and responsive design.
- Allows visual updates without modifying the HTML content.

### **3. JavaScript**

- JavaScript adds **interactivity** to web pages.
- Enables features like buttons, menus, animations, and dynamic content.
- Can retrieve data from a server asynchronously using APIs.

These core technologies—along with additional assets like images, fonts, and videos—make up nearly every modern web application.

## Static vs. Dynamic Content

Web applications can serve **static** or **dynamic** content.

### **Static Content**

- Similar to a printed newspaper: the content remains the same for every visitor.
- Delivered as pre-generated files without additional processing.
- Fast and efficient, ideal for blogs and portfolios.

### **Dynamic Content**

- Like a live news broadcast: content updates in real time.
- Requires backend processing and database queries.
- Used for ecommerce sites, social media, and personalized dashboards.

Most modern web applications use a combination of both, pre-rendering common elements while dynamically injecting user-specific data.

## Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) and Edge Networks

A **Content Delivery Network (CDN)** speeds up websites by storing copies of files in multiple geographic locations. Instead of every visitor downloading files from a single server (which may be far away), they receive content from the **closest CDN node**.

### Why Use a CDN?

- **Faster load times** by reducing the distance between the user and the content.
- **Lower server load** by distributing traffic across multiple locations.
- **Better availability** by serving content even if the origin server goes offline.

An **Edge Network** takes this concept further by running small bits of code close to the user, enabling quick responses like authentication checks, redirects, and personalized data delivery.

## Frameworks and Abstractions

Building a website from scratch using only **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** is possible, but as projects grow in complexity, frameworks help streamline development.

A **framework** is a pre-built collection of tools, patterns, and best practices that make building web applications faster and easier.

### **Example Frameworks**

- **Next.js** (by Vercel) – Enhances React with routing, performance optimizations, and server-side rendering.
- **React** – A JavaScript library for building reusable UI components.
- **Vue.js** – A progressive framework for building user interfaces.
- **Svelte** – A framework that compiles components into efficient JavaScript code.

Frameworks help developers focus on building features rather than worrying about low-level performance and routing optimizations.
