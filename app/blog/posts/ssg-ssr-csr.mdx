Building a web application involves making a crucial decision: **How should your pages be rendered?** The choice between **Static Site Generation (SSG), Server-Side Rendering (SSR), and Client-Side Rendering (CSR)** can significantly impact **performance, SEO, and user experience**.

In this guide, we’ll break down **SSG, SSR, and CSR**, explaining how each works, their pros and cons, and when to use them.

---

## What is Rendering?

Rendering is how a webpage **turns raw code (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) into a fully displayed webpage** for users. Different rendering strategies determine **where** and **when** this transformation happens.

The three main rendering strategies are:

- **SSG (Static Site Generation)** – Pre-generates pages at **build time**.
- **SSR (Server-Side Rendering)** – Renders pages **on the server** for each request.
- **CSR (Client-Side Rendering)** – Loads a minimal page, then uses JavaScript to fetch and render content **on the client**.

Each approach has its trade-offs in terms of **speed, SEO, and interactivity**.

## Static Site Generation (SSG)

### How It Works

With **SSG**, pages are generated **at build time** and served as static HTML files. When a user visits the site, the content is instantly available.

1. At build time, the system pre-renders all pages.
2. The static files are uploaded to a Content Delivery Network (CDN).
3. Users get a **fully-rendered page instantly** from the nearest CDN.

### Performance Impact

- **Blazing fast load times** (because files are served from a CDN).
- **Best for SEO** (fully rendered pages are available immediately).
- **Scales efficiently** (no database or backend calls per request).
- **Not ideal for real-time updates** (requires rebuilding for content changes).

### When to Use SSG

- **Marketing websites, blogs, and documentation**.
- **E-commerce product pages** that don’t update frequently.
- **Portfolio websites** with pre-defined content.

### Example Use Case

A **personal blog** is a great use case for SSG. Blog posts don’t change frequently, so pre-rendering them at build time ensures fast loading and great SEO.

## Server-Side Rendering (SSR)

### How It Works

With **SSR**, pages are generated **on-demand, at request time**.

1. A user requests a page.
2. The server **fetches data** and renders the page.
3. The complete HTML page is sent to the browser.

### Performance Impact

- **Fresh, up-to-date content on every request**.
- **Better for dynamic pages** than SSG (no need to rebuild).
- **Good for SEO** (search engines get fully-rendered pages).
- **Slower initial load** (server must process every request).
- **Higher server costs** (requires backend processing per visit).

### When to Use SSR

- **Dynamic dashboards** with user-specific content.
- **E-commerce sites with real-time stock updates**.
- **News websites where articles change frequently**.

### Example Use Case

An **e-commerce product page** that needs to display real-time inventory and pricing is an ideal use case for SSR.

## Client-Side Rendering (CSR)

### How It Works

With **CSR**, the **initial HTML is minimal**, and JavaScript loads the content dynamically in the browser.

1. The user visits the page.
2. The page loads a **basic shell** with no content.
3. JavaScript fetches and renders data **after the page loads**.

### Performance Impact

- **Faster initial response** (lighter server load).
- **Better for highly interactive applications**.
- **Reduces server-side processing cost**.
- **Slower for SEO** (content loads asynchronously).
- **Poorer experience for slow network users** (requires JavaScript execution).

### When to Use CSR

- **Single Page Applications (SPAs) like React and Vue apps**.
- **User dashboards** that rely on frequent client-side updates.
- **Chat applications and real-time collaboration tools**.

### Example Use Case

A **real-time chat application** benefits from CSR since content is constantly changing and doesn’t need to be pre-rendered.

## Comparing SSG, SSR, and CSR

| Feature             | **SSG (Static Site Generation)** | **SSR (Server-Side Rendering)**           | **CSR (Client-Side Rendering)**     |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| **Speed**           | 🚀 Extremely fast (CDN-cached)   | 🏎️ Slower (server processes each request) | 🚀 Fast after initial load          |
| **SEO**             | ✅ Best (pre-rendered content)   | ✅ Good (content rendered on request)     | ❌ Challenging (requires hydration) |
| **User Experience** | ✅ Instant load times            | ⚠️ Can be slow on first load              | ✅ Best for interactive apps        |
| **Data Freshness**  | ❌ Requires rebuilds for updates | ✅ Always fresh                           | ✅ Real-time updates                |
| **Server Load**     | ✅ Low (static files)            | ❌ High (processing per request)          | ✅ Low (client handles rendering)   |

## How Rendering Choices Impact Performance

- **SSG is the fastest** because files are served from a CDN with no additional processing.
- **SSR adds processing time** since the server generates pages on demand.
- **CSR delays content display** as JavaScript needs to fetch and render it dynamically.

For best performance, many modern frameworks use **a hybrid approach**—combining SSG, SSR, and CSR where appropriate.

## Choosing the Right Rendering Strategy

| **Use Case**                                   | **Best Rendering Method** |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Personal blogs, marketing pages                | **SSG**                   |
| Real-time dashboards                           | **CSR**                   |
| E-commerce product pages with frequent updates | **SSR**                   |
| Static documentation websites                  | **SSG**                   |
| Social media apps                              | **CSR**                   |
